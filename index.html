	<h1>v4913's Webpage</h1>
	<p>Welcome!</p>
	<p>I'm Vivian Loh, a rising senior in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I'm a comp math main, or more accurately a <a href="/math.html">geometry</a> main. I sometimes rant about philosophy on AoPS, and I'm still trying to figure out what to do with my life!</p>
	<p>I currently run <a href="https://athemath.org/" target="_blank">Athemath</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing female representation in math. I inherited ownership of this from its original founder, Ali Cy, who did all of the work.</p>
	<p>I also teach for <a href="https://live.poshenloh.com/" target="_blank">Daily Challenge</a>, which you should consider applying to if you're a high school student in the U.S. or Canada (except California because of their laws which will hopefully change soon).</p>
	<p>Here you can see how little I actually have to say about myself...</p>
